- 👋 Hi, I’m @tg270798
- 👀 I’m interested in Big Data, Data Engineering related fields
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced SQL, how to work with big data, creating pipelines to channelize the data flow and also how to use databricks to make validations and cleaning of data
- 💞️ I’ll be happy to work with anyone who is working on big data as it'll be a great learning oppurtunity for me...
- 📫 Drop a mail if you need a helping hand ... sharmatathagat1@gmail.com
